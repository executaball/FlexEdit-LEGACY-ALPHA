FlexEdit Version 1.0.7 hotfix (ALPHA) by executaball

Disclaimer: Prerelease alpha builds have basic framework functioning but major functions may be missing. I suggest you wait for the first beta version (coming soon)

Please email at 'executaball@yahoo.com' for problems / bugs. (Probably has many)


*INSTRUCTIONS*

Requires microsoft .NET Framework 4.7 to work.

If you already have .NET Framework 4.7, go to /Application Files/FlexEdit_version#/ and simply run "FlexEdit.exe". You do not need to install it.

If you do not have .NET, please run the installer 'setup.exe'

The program can then be uninstalled easily by visiting 'Uninstall a Program or feature"



*CHANGELOG*

5/11/2017 - v1.0.7 alpha -> HOTFIX build. Fixed major issue of crashing when clicking export button with an empty database (saveword not loaded). Improved general error handling as well. Using official microsoft API now. Still wouldn't call error handling 'robust' though.

5/10/2017 - v1.0.6 alpha -> First prerelease public build, major framework complete but major functions missing. Demonstration build only. Advise against using.
