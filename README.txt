Please email at 'executaball@yahoo.com' for problems / bugs. (Probably has many)

Requires microsoft .NET Framework 4.7 to work.

If you already have .NET Framework 4.7, go to /Application Files/FlexEdit_1_0_0_6/ and simply run "FlexEdit.exe". You do not need to install it.

If you do not have .NET, please run the installer 'setup.exe'

The program can then be uninstalled easily by visiting 'Uninstall a Program or feature"
